/* Hailstone compiled plugins: the C interface a plugin (a .dll / .so / .dylib) is built against.
 *
 * The names follow MacroQuest's plugin callbacks, so an MQ plugin's structure carries over: export the callbacks
 * you need (InitializePlugin, ShutdownPlugin, OnPulse, SetGameState, OnZoned, OnIncomingChat, ...) and talk to the
 * client through the host table (PluginHostApi) it hands you before InitializePlugin (HAILSTONE_PLUGIN in one source
 * file keeps it in the global `host` and gives WriteChatf, DoCommand, AddCommand, ParseMacroData,
 * AddTopLevelObject, ...). MQ's sources do not build as they are: they read eqgame.exe's memory layouts, which
 * this client does not have; the game is reached through TLOs instead (ParseMacroData("${Me.PctHPs}") or the TLO
 * functions).
 *
 * The server decides what loads (docs/plugins.md): its own plugins (sent from its client_files/plugins/) always
 * load; the player's only when its hailstone.cfg allows them, with the capabilities it grants (HAILSTONE_CAP_*). A
 * server without a hailstone.cfg sets no rules. The client loads a copy of exactly the bytes it hashed.
 * Calls the plugin may not make fail (return 0 / -1) and say so in the chat window.
 *
 * Server extensions (ABI 2): a plugin can also change the client's rules where a server's own client differs from
 * the stock one, without a change to Hailstone. It exports a hook table (hailstone_plugin_hooks, HailstoneHooks below)
 * the core asks at those points, and sets what it knows through the host table (class masks, the pet list, rule
 * switches, vitals). Several plugins may do so at once: the client asks them in load order and takes the first
 * answer (docs/plugins.md). A plugin is active from its load; set_active(0) keeps it out until it knows its server.
 * All of this needs HAILSTONE_CAP_EXTEND.
 *
 * Web pages (ABI 3): a plugin opens its own tabs of the in-game browser, draws them in its windows and talks to
 * the page (web_*; HAILSTONE_CAP_WEB; docs/browser.md).
 *
 * Compatibility: the tables only grow at their end and carry their size. A plugin built for an older ABI loads in a
 * newer client; one built for a newer ABI does not load in an older client.
 *
 * Plain C, no C++ types across the boundary: build with any compiler. Every string the client passes is valid only
 * during the call; strings the plugin returns are copied by the client before the call returns.
 *
 * Threads: the client calls the plugin on its own thread, and the host table is for that thread only, from inside
 * one of the plugin's callbacks (InitializePlugin, OnPulse, a command, a hook ...): the client's state has no locks.
 * A call from a thread the plugin started does nothing and returns 0 / NULL (a line in the log says so, once). A
 * plugin that works on a thread of its own hands its results over and acts on them in OnPulse.
 *
 * Exceptions: a C++ plugin must not let an exception out of any function the client calls (callbacks, commands,
 * TLOs, hooks, UI functions). The client catches what it can and treats the call as unanswered (an exception out of
 * InitializePlugin or hailstone_plugin_hooks unloads the plugin with everything it registered), but an exception
 * crossing a C interface is undefined behaviour, and one from a plugin built with another compiler or runtime may
 * end the client. */
